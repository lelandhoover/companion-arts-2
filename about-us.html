    <img src="images/lotus-1.jpg" alt="Lotus" width="250" class="imgfloatright">
    <p>Companion Arts enhances the quality of life of family and professional caregivers by providing innovative and evidence-based services, products, and resources. Our work with caregivers is based on our values:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Compassion and well-being drive our mission to serve caregivers;</li>
      <li>Creativity, innovation, and learning drive how we serve caregivers;</li>
      <li>Sustainability and a results-orientation drive our resource model and focus on measurably improving caregivers' lives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Companion Arts, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization, was co-founded in 2002 by Michael Stillwater and Gary Malkin, creators of the acclaimed audio resource, Graceful Passages:  A Companion for Living and Dying.</p>

    <p>Over the years Companion Arts has developed a number of customized programs for major healthcare institutions and audio resources for professional caregivers (Care for the Journey, Vol. 1 & Vol 2, considered "new classics" in the field); we've also explored how music and messages have a strong, positive affect on individual healing (Heart of Healing™).</p>

    <p>This year we've regrouped to forge new perspectives on 1) cutting edge resources for caregivers and 2) how the arts can be utilized for caregivers' benefit.   Later this year these new ideas will find rich expression in Care For The Journey™ programs and resources.</p>

    <p>Companion Arts also has an extraordinary Advisory Board as well as renown caregiving experts advising the Care For the Journey program.</p>
