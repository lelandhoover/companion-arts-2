					<p>Maria Hoaglund’s <em><strong><a href="http://companionarts.hostedbyamazon.com/The-Most-Important-Your-Life/dp/0975293214">The Most Important Day of Your Life</a></strong></em> should be on everyone’s “Most Important Books to Read” list. Yet the subject of Death is generally taboo in our society &mdash;  most people aren’t motivated to consider end-of-life until the death of a loved one or diagnosis of a terminal illness.</p>
					<p><em>The Most Important Day</em> challenges and reframes this perspective. Hoaglund confronts fear of death with multi-cultural experience as a chaplain and Hospice Counselor/Spiritual Advisor, and writes with a candid, refreshing openness to everyday experience and today’s lifestyles. Each chapter features an exercise that inspires or broadens one's personal perspective while lessening anxiety about death and dying. In addition, the book’s appendix contains two interesting, helpful articles: “Suggestions for Death Care Reform in America” and “20 Questions You’ve Always Wanted To Ask A Hospice Counselor”.</p>
					<p>This book is required reading for <strong>anyone</strong> who wants to live deeply with inspiration, less fear of dying and increased insight &hellip; <em>this book is much more about "living" than "dying"</em>!  Many hospices, hospitals and chaplains will also want to utilize <em><strong><a href="http://companionarts.hostedbyamazon.com/The-Most-Important-Your-Life/dp/0975293214">The Most Important Day of Your Life</a></strong></em> as reading for patients, volunteers, staff and pastoral education/resources.</p>

						<h2>Author Bio</h2>
						<h3>Maria  Hoaglund</h3>
						<img src="images/speakers/Maria-Hoaglund-7a-web.jpg" alt="Maria Dancing Heart Hoaglund portrait">
					</header>
					<p>Maria &quot;Dancing Heart&quot; Hoaglund is an acclaimed international author, energy healer, UCC minister, and end-of-life coach.</p>
					<p>She grew up in Japan, the daughter of Lutheran missionaries.  As a result, she is bilingual and bi-cultural, and has utilized this wonderful combination of language and cultural skills throughout her life.</p>
					<p>After finishing high school at Canadian Academy in Kobe, Japan, Maria moved to the United States for college. She graduated from Yale University with a B.A., and subsequently received her Masters of Divinity from Chicago Theological Seminary.</p>
					<p>In 1985 she began parish ministry at Church of the Crossroads in Honolulu, Hawaii, where she was ordained in the United Church of Christ. She continued in parish ministry for ten years, serving several UCC churches in Hawaii and in the Great Northwest.</p>
					<p>The focus of her ministry changed in 1995 when she began working as a Bereavement Coordinator for a Puget Sound hospice. She added spiritual counseling to her repertoire that same year, and continued with this work until the international release of her first book, <em>The Last Adventure of Life</em>.</p>
					<p>Her books have received international acclaim and have been widely appreciated by baby boomers, caregivers, care recipients, and holistic practitioners who desire to deepen their spiritual life by examining and releasing their fears around death and transition.</p>

					<header><h2>Editorial Reviews</h2></header>
					<p>Maria has written a book that is guaranteed to open up conversations about end-of-life issues. Using stories and anecdotes, she takes us through anxiety and fears about death and dying with humor and meditation exercises to help not just when we are dying but long before the thought even enters our minds. She compares her hospice work to a near-death experience in slow motion-- how she has come to see the light through being with the dying, and ends the book with 20 questions you've always wanted to ask a hospice counselor.</p>
					<blockquote>-- <strong>Diane Goble</strong>, Founder, Transitions Training</blockquote>
					<p>Once again, Maria Dancing Heart has written a heartfelt and inspiring book about befriending death. Her stories and learned wisdom from years as a hospice counselor draw us into the beauty, mystery, and light of the ultimate passage of life: dying. Of the multitude of treasures that live within this slim volume, perhaps the most impactful is its contribution to the wave of awakening consciousness. Specifically, the veils of taboo and silence around death and dying that are held so dearly in this culture drop away effortlessly through the author's words, and we are uplifted into reverence and joy for life itself--in all of its variations and conditions. And the more we can say yes to life, the more we can say yes to the most important day of our life.</p>
					<blockquote>-- <strong>Julie Clayton</strong>, <em>New Consciousness Review</em></blockquote>
					<p>Death is a part of life! We work so hard in our society today to ignore death – to push it away – to deny that it could happen to us or to any of our loved ones. We go to doctors and ask what more can you do to help me, to keep me "alive." Rev. Maria Dancing Heart Hoaglund has a wonderful new book out. <em>The Most Important Day of Your Life: Are You Ready?</em> is a little book, easily read, and yet full of powerful reminders that death is a part of life. As a spiritual director, I found good suggestions of how I can be present with people who are facing death. And we all face death! So there are also ways I can be more present to my own life. Each chapter has exercises to give the reader new ways of looking at this important day of our life. And each chapter has a little bit of humor. We need to laugh at death, not just fear it. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is walking with someone in the last days of his/her life – whether that is your parent, a member of your congregation, a client, a loved one. This book is for you to help you be more present to the now in a positive way. It will help you to be a loving witness on this important journey called life, that includes death.</p>
					<blockquote>-- <strong>Marcia McLaughlin</strong>, Spiritual Director</blockquote>
